# ERC20 TOKEN & VAULT

This project involves a simple ERC20 token deployed on mysubnet local network and a token Vault deployed on the same network.

## Description

The ERC20 token follows a standard set of functions which includes how the tokens can be transferred, how transactions are approved, how users can access data about a token, and the total supply of tokens. The use of smart contracts in ERC-20 tokens enables the automation and enforcement of complex financial operations, which is crucial for DeFi platforms.

The token vault is a smart contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw their ERC20 tokens. Essentially, the vault manages the token, providing a layer of abstraction that allows for more complex interactions with the token
